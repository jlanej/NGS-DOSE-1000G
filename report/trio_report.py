"""A printable assessment of NGS-DOSE on the cohort, written for a sceptic and focused on the trios:
the methods in brief, a heatmap of transmission statistics for every metric (what is claimed to be
inherited, what must be, what cannot be), a child-against-midparent scatter for each metric, the
same test run on the fetch counts alone, and the satellite arrays against long-read assemblies.
The results (sample counts, estimates, correlations, reliabilities, intervals, batch tallies) are
read from what `python -m report` writes. The method description and its constants (31-mers, 800
control regions, 250-bp windows, 1,000 permutations, the 80/60/40 truth-region counts and the
expected copy numbers) are fixed text.
