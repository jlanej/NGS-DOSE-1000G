# The cohort run

The expanded 1000 Genomes cohort (3,202 samples, 602 trios; NYGC, TruSeq PCR-free, NovaSeq
2×150, GRCh38) is the validation cohort for NGS-DOSE: it is public, it has trios, many samples
have HPRC assemblies, and NGS-PCA has already been run on it (`../meta/ngspca/`).

| path | what |
| --- | --- |
| `../pilot/` | four trios, each sample also as an independent older library; run locally; counts files, the evaluation and plotting scripts, the report and the figure are there |
| `00_setup.sh`, `01_stage_and_dose.sh`, `01a_dispatch_staged.sh`, `01b_dose_sample.sh`, `01_count.sh`, `02_cohort.sh`, `03_compare_modes.sh` (+ `compare_modes.py`), `04_hprc_satellites.sh`, `05_report.sh`, `config.sh` | the full-cohort run, for SLURM or a plain loop |
| `ngs-dose.def` | fallback Apptainer definition of the container image |
| `../meta/hprc_r2_censat.keys.txt`, `hprc_satellites.py` | the HPRC release-2 CenSat annotations (S3 keys; 205 samples, 200 of them in this cohort) and the comparison of satellite estimates against them |
| `../meta/ngspca/` | NGS-PCA output for this cohort (200 coverage PCs, `AUTO_HQ_median`), produced by [NGS-PCA's 1000G example](https://github.com/jlanej/NGS-PCA/tree/master/example/1000G_highcov) |

## The pilot

```bash
REF=/path/to/GRCh38_full_analysis_set_plus_decoy_hla.fa bash ../pilot/run_pilot.sh
```

counts every sample in fetch mode straight from the public CRAMs (AWS Open Data mirror for the
NYGC data, EBI for the HGSVC replicates) and writes [`pilot/pilot_report.md`](../pilot/pilot_report.md).
`python pilot/evaluate_pilot.py` (from the repository root) alone regenerates the report from the committed counts files.

The replicates are what make the pilot informative. HG00512/3/4, HG00731/2/3 and NA19238/39/40
were sequenced years earlier for the HGSVC (HiSeq 2500, 2×126, ~78×, bwakit + postalt), and the
CEU trio for Illumina's Platinum pedigree (HiSeq 2000, 2×101, ~54×): different library
preparation, chemistry, read length, insert size, depth and alignment pipeline, and a GC
response that is the reverse of NYGC's. Agreement between the two is reproducibility of the
*measurement*, not of the file — and an upper bound on its error, because the two DNA batches
come from different cultures of the cell line.

`python pilot/evaluate_pilot.py --write-anchors` additionally rewrites the method's
`resources/GRCh38/anchors.json` (the installed bundle) from the replicate pairs; `python pilot/plot_pilot.py` draws
`pilot_figure.png` (needs matplotlib).

## The cohort

Full accuracy for everyone: every CRAM is staged, scanned whole, fetched as well (three seconds
more on a local file), verified, and removed.

Nothing is installed on the cluster: the image holds the engine, the `ngsdose` package, the
resource bundle and `aria2c`; these scripts come with this repository; the host needs Apptainer,
SLURM, `curl` and the coreutils. (From a checkout of NGS-DOSE instead: leave `SIF` unset, point
`NGSDOSE_SRC` at it, `cargo build --release`, `pip install .`.)

```bash
apptainer pull ngs-dose.sif docker://ghcr.io/jlanej/ngs-dose:latest
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jlanej/NGS-DOSE-1000G   # the scripts submit jobs, so they live on the host
cd NGS-DOSE-1000G/pipeline                              # submit from here: config.sh and logs/ are relative to it
export SIF=/path/to/ngs-dose.sif WORK_DIR=/scratch/$USER/ngs_dose_1000G

bash 00_setup.sh                                        # reference, pedigree, manifest (sample, URL, MD5)
LIMIT=5 bash 01_stage_and_dose.sh                       # smoke test: five samples staged, counted, removed
sbatch 01_stage_and_dose.sh                             # the cohort: a few transfers at a time, one 01b_dose_sample.sh job per CRAM

MODE=scan sbatch 02_cohort.sh                           # estimate, calibrate, adjust, transmission - on the scans
MODE=fetch sbatch 02_cohort.sh                          # the same on the targeted fetches, for the comparison
bash 03_compare_modes.sh                                # sink capture per sample, sinks re-learned, fetch / scan per sample
sbatch 04_hprc_satellites.sh                            # satellite array mass against the HPRC assemblies of the same people
sbatch 05_report.sh                                     # the page: known truths, fetch vs scan, trios, cell line, satellites - from whatever exists
```

**Publishing as the run proceeds.** The counts files are small (~240 kB per scan, ~70 kB per fetch;
under 1 GB for the cohort), public-data derivatives with no reads or genotypes in them, and the
primary product of the run: from them everything else is a minute's computation. They go, as they
land, into a results repository of their own -
[NGS-DOSE-1000G](https://github.com/jlanej/NGS-DOSE-1000G): `counts_scan/`, `counts_fetch/`, and
`docs/` for the page that `05_report.sh` (or that repository's `regenerate.sh`) builds from them,
served by GitHub Pages. `rsync` the two counts directories from `$WORK_DIR` into it, regenerate, commit.
The page is honest about how much of the cohort it rests on, and each section appears when the
data for it exist (three trios for inheritance, twenty for its intervals, sixty samples for the
PC sweep, assemblies for the satellites).

`01_stage_and_dose.sh` keeps a few multi-connection `aria2c` transfers going (the image's
`aria2c`; it checks each file against the MD5 of the sequence index), holds at most
`MAX_LOCAL_CRAMS` files on disk, submits one job per landed CRAM and can be re-run at any time:
finished samples, queued jobs and files already on disk are recognised. Compute nodes need no
internet unless the manager itself runs as a job; on a cluster where they have none, run it on a
login or transfer node (`bash 01_stage_and_dose.sh` in tmux).

`01b_dose_sample.sh SAMPLE LINE [MD5]` has the calling convention of NGS-PCA's
`01b_mosdepth_sample.sh` (verify the MD5 if given, process, check the outputs, delete the CRAM),
so the aria2 download manager that staged this cohort for NGS-PCA can drive it: it needs its
per-sample job script and its "already done" test to be settable (`$WORK_DIR/counts_scan/<sample>.json.gz`
instead of the mosdepth output), nothing else. `01a_dispatch_staged.sh` is for files staged by
other means (Globus, rsync): it neither downloads nor deletes, skips files aria2 is still
writing, and submits each landed CRAM once. About 14 CPU-minutes and 1.3 GB of memory per sample; the counts files
are ~230 kB (scan) and ~70 kB (fetch), so the whole cohort is under 1 GB.

Without staging, `01_count.sh` counts straight from the public bucket, a block of the manifest
per array task: `MODE=fetch` moves ~0.5 GB per sample (1.5 TB for the cohort, about a minute
each) and is how a biobank would run; `MODE=scan` streams the whole file (15 GB per sample over
one connection):

```bash
N=$(wc -l < $WORK_DIR/manifest.tsv)
MODE=fetch sbatch --array=0-$(( (N - 1) / 10 ))%25 01_count.sh
```

**What the full scan buys, and why this cohort should have it.** A scan is placement-independent;
it is the only mode that measures dispersed sequence - ten satellite families, three of them
particular to the acrocentric short arms and pericentromeres (`EXTRA_PANELS` in `config.sh`; 200
samples of the cohort have HPRC assemblies to hold the satellites against; the telomeric repeat,
which the aligner concentrates at the chromosome ends, is fetched as well through the bundle's
sinks, `FETCH_PANELS`) - and that is the one thing that cannot be added afterwards without staging
48 TB again: a new *positional* class can always be fetched later from the few places its reads
land, once a handful of scans has said where those are. And it records, on the 1-kb grid of `mosdepth --by 1000`,
where every class read was aligned *and every other read in those bins* - which is the data
that decides how far the measurement can be simplified for a biobank:

1. **Targeted fetch** (exists): with both modes run on every sample, `03_compare_modes.sh` gives
   fetch / scan per sample across 26 populations and both sexes, and re-learns the sinks at
   n = 3,202 on the finer grid (tighter sinks, fewer requests).
2. **A depth proxy from bins a cohort already has.** NGS-PCA's mosdepth run over this cohort
   (1-kb bins, all contigs, no MAPQ filter, duplicates excluded) is kept. In NA12878, 99.8% of
   the aligned 45S reads sit in 273 of those bins. Whether a fixed set of such bins, normalised
   to the autosomal median, tracks the full estimate - and at what loss of transmission
   reliability, which `ngsdose trios --compare-to` measures directly - needs exactly three
   things: the scans, the kept mosdepth outputs, and the per-bin census that says how much of
   each bin's depth is the class and how its duplicate-flag rate differs from the genome's
   (5.5% against 10.8% in NA12878: a depth tool that drops flagged reads over-reads rDNA by the
   difference, by a different amount in every sample). All three exist after this run.
3. Anything else - fewer or smaller sinks, fewer controls, lower depth - can be tried on the
   counts files alone, because they hold positions, not summaries.

Operational notes:

- `01b_dose_sample.sh` is idempotent under a requeue, verifies that both counts files exist and
  are whole before it removes a CRAM (`KEEP_CRAMS=1` keeps them), and leaves the CRAM in place
  if anything failed. `01_count.sh` is idempotent too (finished samples are skipped), tries each sample three times,
  and exits non-zero if any sample still failed; re-submit to retry those. The engine retries
  failed intervals itself, gives up with exit status 75 when a connection has gone silent for
  five minutes (a dead HTTPS connection waits for ever rather than failing; `timeout` is a
  backstop where it exists, and `--stall-timeout 0` turns the watchdog off, e.g. for files that
  have to be recalled from tape), writes its output under a temporary name and renames it, and
  refuses a BAM/CRAM without an end-of-file marker (a truncated copy decodes without error and
  loses exactly the contigs the rDNA is on).
  `%25` caps concurrent array tasks: the bottleneck is the network, and hundreds of parallel
  readers against one S3 prefix earn throttling rather than speed.
- The manifest's second column may be a local path instead of a URL (e.g. CRAMs staged by
  NGS-PCA's download stage); fetch mode then looks for `<cram>.crai` next to it.
- With `export SIF=/path/to/ngs-dose.sif` both the engine and the Python steps run through
  Apptainer. `00_setup.sh` pulls the image if the file is not there yet
  (`docker://ghcr.io/jlanej/ngs-dose:latest`, published by `.github/workflows/container.yml` on
  every push to `main`, and as `:X.Y.Z` on version tags; a package that has not been made public
  needs `apptainer remote login` first). Where
  nothing has been published, `ngs-dose.def` builds the same image from a checkout
  (`apptainer build --fakeroot`, from the repository root). The scripts bind `$WORK_DIR`, the
  repository, the reference directory and `$CRAM_DIR` (`APPTAINER_BINDS` in `config.sh`).
  Without a container: `cargo build --release` (needs libclang, e.g. `module load llvm`) and
  `pip install .`.
- Every counts file records the SHA-256 of the panel, controls and sinks it was made with and
  the lengths of the contigs it used; `ngsdose estimate` warns if a cohort mixes resource sets
  and refuses a file aligned to another reference build.
- QC columns to look at first in `cohort.tsv`: `truth.auto` (2), `truth.chrX` and `truth.chrY`
  (sex; 1.6 and the like is mosaic loss, common in LCLs), `DJ.cn` (10), `flagged_chromosomes`
  (aneuploidy), `eof_marker`, `gc_curve_max_se`.

### What the cohort run is for

`02_cohort.sh` ends with the table the design is waiting on — transmission reliability of every
candidate estimator (`rDNA45S.18S.flat`, the estimator in the literature; the single-sample
anchor estimate; the calibrated `cn`; 5S; DJ) and of three traits whose answer is known in
advance (`truth.auto`: no variance but error; `chrEBV.copies` and `chrM.copies`: large variance,
none of it transmitted through the nuclear genome - if these come out "reliable", families
share batches and every other reliability in the table is inflated by as much), unadjusted, adjusted on NGS-PCA's coverage PCs and
adjusted on the internal control PCs, each with a family-bootstrap confidence interval, the
spousal correlation, a permuted-family null, and the *paired* bootstrap of every estimator
against the 18S depth ratio (separate intervals are about ±0.09 at 602 trios; the paired
difference is much sharper). The number of PCs is the Marchenko–Pastur default, separately for the two PC
sets (`N_PC=20 N_CTRL_PC=5 sbatch 02_cohort.sh` overrides them), and `pcsweep.*.tsv` with its `.summary.txt` is the evidence for or
against that default: for every number of PCs, the cross-validated error of the known truths
and the reliability of the classes. Further checks that need the cohort and are not scripted yet:

- `DJ.cn` across 3,202 samples: a tight distribution at 10 is the accuracy claim; integer
  outliers (8, 9, 11) are candidate acrocentric rearrangements to look at;
- `truth.auto` and `truth.chrX` by sex as cohort-wide QC, and `flagged_chromosomes` as an LCL
  aneuploidy screen;
- sample-by-sample comparison with Hall et al. 2021 (their Supplementary Data 1 covers 2,419 of
  these samples), including the prediction that the ratio between the two pipelines tracks each
  sample's duplicate-flag rates;
- whether the leading coverage PCs explain estimate variance, and whether reliability rises or
  falls when they are removed;
- inherited one-copy steps along the DJ (seen in three of the four pilot trios) as a Mendelian
  test on integer states: a step in a child and in neither parent is a de novo event or an
  error, and a parental step is transmitted half the time;
- whether DJ, the female X and the leading control PC move together (the S-phase hypothesis);
- whether a child's departure from the midparent tracks the state of the culture it was
  sequenced from (`chrEBV.copies`, `chrM.copies`, the leading control PCs): the part of the
  non-transmitted variance that is biology of the cell line rather than measurement error;
- the two published claims that need exactly this cohort and these controls: a 5S-45S
  correlation (Gibbons et al. 2015; not seen by Hall et al. 2021) and an inverse relation
  between rDNA and mitochondrial DNA abundance (Gibbons et al. 2014) - both now testable within
  one library type, against known-truth regions, with transmission as the arbiter of what is
  signal.
