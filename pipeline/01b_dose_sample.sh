# 01b_dose_sample.sh - NGS-DOSE for one sample whose CRAM is already local
# =============================================================================
# The full-accuracy path: a whole-file scan of a staged CRAM (every class, the
# satellite panel, where every class read was aligned and what else sits in those
# 1-kb bins), then - three seconds more - a targeted fetch of the same file, so
# that every sample of the cohort says exactly what the fast mode would have
# returned for it. Outputs are verified, and only then is the CRAM removed.
#
# Same calling convention as NGS-PCA's 01b_mosdepth_sample.sh, so whatever stages
# CRAMs for that pipeline (its aria2 download manager, its stage watcher, a Globus
# batch) can dispatch this job instead:
#   sbatch 01b_dose_sample.sh SAMPLE_ID MANIFEST_LINE_NUM [CRAM_MD5]
# Expects $CRAM_DIR/SAMPLE_ID.cram and .cram.crai. KEEP_CRAMS=1 leaves them in place.
